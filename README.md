Lesson 1- Introduction to Statistics
A simple analysis of Darwin's maize data was conducted. Height difference between selfed and crossed plants were observed and the mean, standard deviation, standard error, and confidence intervals were calculated.
Data visualisations were made to observe probability distributions of the two types of plants, as well as summary statistics.
Packages @tidyverse, @here, @janitor, @lubrridate, @kableExtra were used.
