## Lesson 1- Introduction to Statistics

* A simple analysis of Darwin's maize data was conducted. Height difference between selfed and crossed plants were observed and the mean, standard deviation, standard error, and confidence intervals were calculated.

* Data visualisations were made to observe probability distributions of the two types of plants, as well as summary statistics.

## Lesson 2- Introduction to Linear Models

* Conducted a linear model anaylsis comparing the two groups in the Darwin's maize data. Estimates, estimates of mean, and confidence intervals were calculated.

* Visual plots were made to test linear model assumption, equal variance, normal distribution, and outliers, and a visual t-test was also plotted to start looking into this for form of distribution to compare the self and cross maize plants.

## Lesson 3- Testing

* Darwin's maize date was used to perform a student's t-test and paired t-test.

* Importance of effect size was looked and type 1 and type 2 errors were also explored and how they can affect repeatability of results.

## Lesson 4- Regression

* Janka data that compared wood hardness and density was imported, cleaned, and plotted.

* Pearson's r test was used to test correlation between density and wood hardness, a regression model made and plotted.

* Mean centred regression, confidence intervals, and effect size were looked.

* Data point residuals, normal distributions, equal variance and outliers were plotted to explore assumptions made by the regression model; standard errors and 95% confidence intervals were also looked at.
